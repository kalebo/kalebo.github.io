I am an undergraduate studying Computer Science at BYU. I enjoy learning about the world and seeing the connections between different fields and areas of study. 

Many of my hobbies revolve around software and in particular open source software. My other hobbies include reading, hiking, camping, cooking, drawing, philosophising, playing [go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), and watching old movies.
